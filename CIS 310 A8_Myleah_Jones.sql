--6.	List the property IDs of any pair of properties that have the same number of bedrooms. 
--For example, one pair would be property ID 2 and property ID 6, because they both have four bedrooms. 
--The first property ID listed should be the major sort key and the second property ID should be the minor sort key.
SELECT A.PROPERTY_ID AS MajorSortKey, B.PROPERTY_ID AS MinorSortKey

--10.	Find the service ID and property ID for each service request 
--whose estimated hours is greater than the number of estimated hours of at least 
--one service request on which the category number is 5.
--MUST USE ANY/ALL OPERATOR

SELECT SR.SERVICE_ID, SR.PROPERTY_ID

            WHERE SR.CATEGORY_NUMBER = 4;



--12.	Output the same information Exercise 11, but this time be sure each property is included 
--regardless of whether the property currently has any service requests.
--*Hint: Consider a different join type.
SELECT P.ADDRESS, P.SQR_FT, P.OWNER_NUM, SR.SERVICE_ID, SR.EST_HOURS, SR.SPENT_HOURS
       FROM PROPERTY P
            LEFT JOIN SERVICE_REQUEST SR ON P.PROPERTY_ID = SR.PROPERTY_ID AND SR.CATEGORY_NUMBER = 4;
